# Creating a Simple OS - following nanobyte

## Steps
- Create "Hello World" Assembly Code [x]
- Divide in Bootloader and Kernel

## Issues with Windows 10
- Makefile isn't working, you need to set up manually the commands (like creating the image and binary files)
- Ubuntu with WSL doesn't run qemu very well, needs to be via windows cmd.
